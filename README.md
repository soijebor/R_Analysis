## ***Challenge Summary***

#### ***MechaCar MPG Regression***
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  * The vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. This is because they both have a positive correlation from the multiple linear regression model

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  * The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, given that the Multiple R-squared is 0.7149 and the p-value of 5.35e-11 is below the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  * We got a p-value is 5.35e-11, which is below the significance level of 0.05% and the Multiple R-squared value is 0.7149.Therefore, 71% of the predictions will be effective using this linear model for the MechaCar prototypes.


#### ***Suspension Coil***
* Suspension Coil Summary
  * After generating the summary statistics for Suspension Coil, I got the following results for the Mean, Median, Variance and Standard Deviation:
   * Mean = 1500
   * Median = 1500
   * Variance = 76.23
   * Standard Deviation = 8.73

* I also generated the summary statistics for Suspension Coil based on Manufacturing Lots using the group_by function
        Mean     Median  Variance SD
#Lot1   1500.    1500.   1.15    1.07
#Lot2   1500.    1499.   10.1    3.18
#Lot3   1499.    1498.   220.    14.8 


* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?

  * Overall the suspension coil has a variance of 76.23 which meets the design specifications but after grouping them by manufacturing lot, I found out that Lot 3 does not meet the design specifications for the variance of the suspension coil must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.
  
* Visualization of the distribution using density plot:

  * My second sample data

* T-test
  * The p-value is above the assumed significance level. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we can confirm our two samples are not statistically different.

#### Design Your Own Study:

Design a study that compares the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market. In the MechaCarWriteUp.txt text file, write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar outperforms the competition. In your study design, be sure to write about the following considerations:

 * Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).
 * Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.
 * Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?


***For my study, i picked 2 metrics which i think are of a consumer interest:***
* Cost - Sales price is very important to a consumer on a budget
  * Simple Linear Regression - Continuous
  
     H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0
     
     Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m ≠ 0
     
* Hosepower - Generally people want mor hose power especially if they are into sport cars
  * ANOVA Test - Continuous
  
    H0 : The means of all groups are equal, or µ1 = µ2 = … = µn.
    
    Ha : At least one of the means is different from all other groups.

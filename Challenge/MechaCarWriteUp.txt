* MechaCar MPG Regression
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- The vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. This is because they both have a positive correlation from the multiple linear regression model

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, given that the Multiple R-squared is 0.7149 and the p-value of 5.35e-11 is below the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- We got a p-value is 5.35e-11, which is below the significance level of 0.05% and the Multiple R-squared value is 0.7149.Therefore, 71% of the predictions will be effective using this linear model for the MechaCar prototypes.


* Suspension Coil
* Suspension Coil Summary
After generating the summary statistics for Suspension Coil, I got the following results for the Mean, Median, Variance and Standard Deviation:
- Mean = 1500
- Median = 1500
- Variance = 76.23
- Standard Deviation = 8.73

I also generated the summary statistics for Suspension Coil based on Manufacturing Lots using the group_by function
        Mean     Median  Variance SD
#Lot1   1500.    1500.   1.15    1.07
#Lot2   1500.    1499.   10.1    3.18
#Lot3   1499.    1498.   220.    14.8 


The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?
- Overall the suspension coil has a variance of 76.23 which meets the design specifications but after grouping them by manufacturing lot, I found out that Lot 3 does not meet the design specifications for the variance of the suspension coil must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.

* T-test
- The p-value is above the assumed significance level. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we can confirm our two samples are not statistically different.

* Design Your Own Study:
For my study, I picked 2 metrics which I believe are of a consumer interest:

* Cost - Sales price is very important to a consumer on a budget

Simple Linear Regression - Continuous

H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0

Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m ≠ 0

* Horsepower - Generally people want mor horsepower especially if they are into sport cars

ANOVA Test - Continuous

H0 : The means of all groups are equal, or µ1 = µ2 = … = µn.

Ha : At least one of the means is different from all other groups.
